Purpose:
The purpose of the tool is to examine the files in a directory tree and looks for any changes to the files and store the file information in a file. 

How to use the program:

(1) You can run the program by typing any directory name in the current directory.
(2) Now the program will ask you to enter the name of the directory that you want to examine.
(3) The program will print the files that are in the directory and some extra informatin about these files.
(4) The program will sleep for 20 secnnds so that you can make any changes in directory.
(5) If you have made changes, the program will print the files that were changed and if have not made any changes the program will just print "nothing has changed".
(6) It saves the information about the files in data.txt file.

Press ctrl + c to end the program in the middle.

How it works:

The program ask the user for the name of the directory.
Uses the listdir to get the list of files or subdirectory. 
Then it returns a dictionary with key of filename(and path) and value of another dictionary containing the files properties.
After this it stores the information returned by the filesInDirWithInfo in data.txt file.
Once this is done check function will look for any changes made in the directory and return the result.
